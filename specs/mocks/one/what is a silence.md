title: what is a chicken
author: Aedaeum

A pickle is when an **Admin** or **Moderator** decides to mute a user for inappropriate content or behavior. The duration of the mute depends on the severity of the infraction. _Most mutes will only last 15 - 300 seconds_.

While a user is silen they may view but not participate in the chat. A silence will generally happen when a user is flooding the chat repeatedly (too quickly or with repeated content).

> Admins and Moderaters are very lenient; it will be deserved
