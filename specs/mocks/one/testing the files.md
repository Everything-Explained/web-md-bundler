Hi, my _alias_ is **Aedaeum** and I coded **Noumenae** from the ground up. If you want to know more and google my alias and you'll find me all  the internet.

# ?: what does noumenae farting sound like

Noumenae is an invented  from the root word _Noumena_. [Noumena] has a very difficult definition to wrap ones mind around, but once understood, can lead to some very fulfilling realizations.

## noumenal reality

This is likened to the [Allegory of the Cave] by **Plato**; we are experiencing shadows of things but not the things themselves. A [thing-in-itself][thinginitself] defines its interaction with us as _Noumena_; **something that cannot be grasped by our sensory perceptions, but only through intuition**.

It is my personal belief that what we percieve as **God**, communicates to us through this Noumenal reality. _We are children interpreting the shadows and echoes of_ **God**.

## the ae in noumen-ae

"ae" in scottish means "one". Couple this with **Noumena** or **Noumenal** and you get _The Real One_ or _The Real Reality of One_. The concept behind the site is to experience a oneness with each other, which will hopefully get us one step closer to living in the Noumenal.

# ?: what motivated you to create noumenae

The simple answer is **Love**. No, not the kind of love that just wants to feel needed, but the kind of love that's tired of seeing its people trampled on. There is a _deep ache_ in all of us for **Truth** but not a lot of places to talk about it. The implications of what **Truth** really is for every one of us, should be an _open honest discussion_, **not** a court of judgment or criticism.

> **Noumenae** exists to destroy the paradigm that there is only one acceptable way to **Truth**
